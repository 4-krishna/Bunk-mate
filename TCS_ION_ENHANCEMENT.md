# TCS iON Portal Enhancement Summary

## üéØ Specific Targeting for Your TCS iON Portal

The Bunk Mate extension has been specifically enhanced to extract attendance data from your TCS iON portal structure:

**Your Portal URL**: `https://g21.tcsion.com/SelfServices/home?urn=16365963#`

### üîç Targeted HTML Elements

Based on your provided HTML structure, the extension now specifically looks for:

1. **Direct ID Targeting**:
   - `#cum_slots` - Contains total lectures/classes
   - `#cum_present` - Contains attended lectures/classes

2. **Container Class Targeting**:
   - `._ttlPlan` div - Total planned classes container
   - `._prsntPlan` div - Present classes container

3. **Nested Structure Support**:
   - `._ttlPlan ._value` - Value within total plan container
   - `._prsntPlan ._value` - Value within present plan container

### üöÄ Enhanced Extraction Methods

The extension now uses a 4-tier extraction strategy:

#### Method 1: Direct ID Search (Most Reliable)
```javascript
const totalElement = document.getElementById('cum_slots');
const presentElement = document.getElementById('cum_present');
```
- Directly targets your specific element IDs
- Uses `parseInt()` for clean number extraction
- Validates that numbers are positive and reasonable

#### Method 2: Class-based Search
```javascript
const totalDiv = document.querySelector('._ttlPlan');
const presentDiv = document.querySelector('._prsntPlan');
```
- Searches for your specific div classes
- Looks for `._value` children within these containers
- Falls back to ID search within the containers

#### Method 3: Enhanced Backup Search
- Comprehensive search for all TCS-specific patterns
- Detailed logging of each element found
- Smart filtering based on element content

#### Method 4: Container Analysis
- Fallback to general TCS container analysis
- Pattern matching for various attendance formats

### üîß Technical Improvements

1. **Number Extraction**: Direct `parseInt()` instead of regex for reliability
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout
3. **Debugging**: Detailed console logging for troubleshooting
4. **Validation**: Smart validation of extracted numbers
5. **Domain Support**: Added `*://*.tcsion.com/*` to manifest permissions

### üìã Manifest.json Updates

```json
{
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.tcsion.com/*"
  ],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["*://*.tcsion.com/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### üêõ Debugging Tools

#### TCS-Specific Debug Script
**File**: `debug-tcs-specific.js`

This script specifically tests your TCS iON portal structure:
- Tests for `cum_slots` and `cum_present` elements
- Analyzes `_ttlPlan` and `_prsntPlan` containers
- Shows all TCS-related elements found
- Provides detailed extraction analysis

#### Usage:
1. Go to your TCS iON attendance page
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
3. Copy and paste the entire `debug-tcs-specific.js` content
4. Press Enter and analyze the output

### üéØ Expected Behavior

When you navigate to your TCS iON portal attendance page and click "Detect from TCS iON":

1. **Success Case**: The extension should automatically detect and fill in:
   - Total classes from `#cum_slots` element
   - Attended classes from `#cum_present` element
   - Display "Data detected from: tcs_specific"

2. **Fallback Cases**: If direct ID search fails, it will try:
   - Class-based search in `_ttlPlan` and `_prsntPlan` divs
   - Enhanced backup search through all TCS elements
   - General container analysis

3. **Debug Information**: Detailed console logs showing:
   - Which elements were found
   - What text was extracted
   - Which method succeeded
   - Any errors encountered

### üîÑ Testing Instructions

1. **Install the Extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable Developer Mode
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the Bunk-mate folder

2. **Test on Your Portal**:
   - Navigate to: `https://g21.tcsion.com/SelfServices/home?urn=16365963#`
   - Go to your attendance page
   - Click the Bunk Mate extension icon
   - Click "Detect from TCS iON"

3. **Debug if Needed**:
   - Open Console (F12)
   - Use the TCS-specific debug script
   - Check for console messages starting with "[Bunk Mate Debug]:"

### üìä Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Working Correctly**:
- Numbers automatically populate in the extension popup
- Console shows "‚úÖ Successfully extracted via direct ID search"
- Extension displays "Data detected from: tcs_specific"

‚ùå **Needs Debugging**:
- No numbers are detected
- Console shows "‚ùå No attendance data found"
- Extension shows "This page doesn't appear to contain attendance data"

If you encounter issues, please:
1. Run the TCS-specific debug script
2. Share the console output
3. Mention what attendance numbers are visible on your page

The extension is now specifically optimized for your TCS iON portal structure!
